# Web-Design-Challenge

This project involved creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we created in a past assignment. We used the OpenWeatherMap API to collect various weather data (max temp., humidity, cloudiness, wind speed) from several different cities around the world. The goal is to analyze the effect latitude has on the four different weather conditions mentioned.

The dashboard website was created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

The site has a landing page, a data page with a responsive table, indpendent pages for each data visualization, and a page that compares each plot simultaneously.

Analysis is provided for each plot on their individual pages.
